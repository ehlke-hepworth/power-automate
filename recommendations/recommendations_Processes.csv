Level,Processes & Responsibility Framework
1,"Identify a capability design process to develop the capability by unpacking: the ‘job-to-be-done’ by the Impact Management 
Capability; defining the capability model (including the Impact Management sub-capabilities needed); define the boundaries 
of the Impact Management Capability (what it does do and what it doesn’t do); identify and define the high-level processes 
this capability will need to lead in order to fulfil the purpose and stakeholder needs; determine the responsibility assignment 
framework PACE. See example of PACE application. The capability design process above will assist to inform the development 
of role profiles (based on PACE); and workplans.​ "

3,"In conjunction with Team composition recommendations, implement a capability design process to develop the capability 
by unpacking: the ‘job-to-be-done’ by the Impact Management Capability; defining the capability model (including the Impact 
Management sub-capabilities needed); define the boundaries of the Impact Management Capability (what it does do and what 
it doesn’t do); identify and define the high-level processes this capability will need to lead in order to fulfil the purpose and 
stakeholder needs; determine the responsibility assignment framework PACE . See example of PACE application. ​Develop 
more detailed processes once the team is in place. The capability design process above will assist to inform the development 
of role profiles (based on PACE); and workplans.​ An option could be to work with a partner to initially develop the processes 
that will guide the Impact Management Capability team. "
4,"Review and refine the capability design process to develop the capability by unpacking: the ‘job-to-be-done’ by the Impact 
Management Capability; defining the capability model (including the Impact Management sub-capabilities needed); define 
the boundaries of the Impact Management Capability (what it does do and what it doesn’t do); identify and define the

team is in place. The capability design process above will assist to inform the development of role profiles (based on PACE); 
and workplans.​ An option could be to work with a partner to initially develop the processes that will guide the Impact 
Management Capability team. Socialise the responsibility assignment framework and processes across all levels of the 
organziation to ensure it is understood and can support effective work across capabilities and consistent execution of 
processes.​ Plan for a retrospective review of processes and PACE, ensure actions for refinement based on lessons learnt 
are planned for.  "

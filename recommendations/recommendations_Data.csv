and integrated into processes, data architecture and data governance measures for the initiative. ​This may practically mean a 
phased approach to implementing select data quality standards as integration and embedding are possible within the initiative’s 
environment.",

considering issues of consent, respect and care for protection and use of personal information. These may be governed by 
social norms and expectations, but in some cases may have legal implications and may require policies and protocols to

Theory of Change. See the example Impact Measurement framework overview to guide the type of information typically
 included in the Impact Measurement Framework. Ensure all new ‘programmes’ (and / communities operating in) have aligned 
Impact Measurement Frameworks as they are built out and are incorporated end-to-end. Include stakeholder engagement in 
the process to ensure measures identified are practical and you are able to collect the proposed data in practice. Combine this 
stakeholder engagement with the selection of appropriate tools that are fit-for-context (i.e. relevant for the organization's 
operating environment, stakeholders and capabilities) and fit-for-purpose.","Finalize and implement the templates and training (see ”equipping” in Talent dimensions) required to socialise the Impact
